        Hi there! This is the space a created
        myself to share some stuff with the world. As you might already know if you personally
        know me, I'm a person with several interests,
        most of them related to STEM field.<br>
        I assume you noticed the dark tone of the page; I always use black, and I do like rock music
        as well as some pop artist, like Sia or Imagine Dragons. My favourite genres are Deathrock, New Wave and Darkwave though.
      </p>

      <h2>A bit about my background</h2>

      <p>
        I'm based in Quito-Ecuador. This is a beautiful and
        diverse country where people use to be gentile. not
        to mention how beautiful landscapes are. <br>
          I love learning, so throughout the years I've been dedicated to learn a lot of stuff. Among those things are programming, languages, history, economics, psychology, computer science but focused mainly on stem disciplines previous to the beginning of my career. <br>
          I'm majoring in physics and for the record, despite I've found this career tremendously challenging I've also found it beautiful. Ironically I started learning programming due to the fact that it is mandatory in the discipline; prior to the journey I didn't even know how to handle Windows OS properly.

          I speak spanish, english, portuguese, german, french, and italian (the
        order is how proficient I am in each of them, from C2 to A2). My goal is to speak at least ten languages before I reach 35. In case you have question or need to contact me, feel free to do it in your native language if listed.
      </p>

		  <h2>About this, my little space</h2>

      <p>Since I've created since to share some stuff (mine and some things I consider everybody should have access too), you'll find here some articles, projects, readings and some art of mine that I've worked on since teen. I love painting, drawing, playing the bass and singing. If you have questions regarding the content hereby provided, Feel free to contact me.</br>

        Welcome to my little space :)
